Summoner's War AFK Tool:

Intro & Disclaimer
	
	Disclaimer: Using this tool and even using an emulator for this tool to run violates ToS. Developers, use & test at your own risk. Players, use at your own risk. If testing the tool just out of curiosity, I suggest using alts or dummy accounts you don't care about. If you use it to automate your game, you will be in violation of ToS and run the risk of being banned!

	The goal of this tool is to automate certain processes in game. Targeting both the 'Repeat Battle' & 'Energy Refresh using crystals' functions as well as ability to subvert afk checking protocols deployed by the game's developers (microtransaction ad popups and mana quizzes @ 10 energy refreshes without logging out). 

	I'd prefer this tool be kept open source and nonpaid as it would be harder for Com2Us to shut it down, as it does violate tos. Paid tools exist already, but I would like to create something in my own shop to use personally, (both in game and on my dev portfolio). If anyone needs to reach out to me regarding the project, my Discord is: kamiyal
